The tagger also uses heuristics to handle unknown words, improving accuracy when evaluated on a test dataset. Project Details Objective: To build a simple POS tagger and evaluate its accuracy by comparing tagged words against a gold-standard test dataset. Training Data: Processes training data to build a lexicon that maps each word to its most frequent POS tag. Tagging Approach: Uses the most common tag per word for known words and assigns the overall most common tag to unknown words. Heuristics for Unknown Words: Tags numbers as CD (cardinal numbers). Tags capitalized words as NNP (proper nouns). Uses suffix"
